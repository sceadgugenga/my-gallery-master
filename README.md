This project uses flexbox and grid to show a profile, stats, and a gallery of multiple images of differing sizes. Additionally, calc and clamp were used to help with responsiveness. I learned that the short-hand <code> flex: 1; </code> is the equivalent to <code> flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1;flex-basis: 0; </code>.
